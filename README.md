Four Letter Word Quiz
Noah Guerin

My portfolio on GitLab contains one folder for my project "four_letter_word", one folder for my libraries "libraries", and five other folders for the exercises I completed.

The project I was given was the 'Four-Letter Word Quiz'. I managed to complete all the requirements and expansions. The game is played just as it is explained on Canvas.
My code is split up into separate functions efficiently and uses both call-by-value and call-by-reference. 
The serial monitor is not used to log any data, as it is needed to provide information to the user throughout the program, and would also take up too much memory. 
I have created my own libraries which the project made use of to be more efficient, along with other libraries. 
I have made use of everything we have learned throughout the first four weeks, apart from the potentiometer as there is no possible use for it in this project, and we were not asked to include. 
I have made use of memory management, which allows the game to be played as many times as you want in the same session, by freeing up memory from the struct every new game.
